The diagram outlines a **Sitemap Crawler** project designed to assist with **SEO** by extracting and analyzing key website metadata from a sitemap. Below are the **key points** based on the diagram:

### 1. **Purpose of the Project**
   - The sitemap crawler is used to visit links in a sitemap and gather SEO-related metadata like:
     - **URL**
     - **Title**
     - **H1 tags**
     - **Meta descriptions**
   - This data helps analyze and improve website SEO performance.

---

### 2. **Core Functionalities and Steps**
   
#### **Step 1: Data Struct Definition**
   - **Struct Creation**:
     - A struct called `SEOdata` is defined to hold the metadata for each page:
       - `url`, `title`, `h1`, and `metadescription`.

---

#### **Step 2: User Agent Management**
   - **User Agents**:
     - A list of different user agents (browser identifiers) is created.
     - This helps in mimicking requests from various browsers and avoiding being blocked by the target site.

---

#### **Step 3: Random User Agent Selection**
   - **Random Function**:
     - A function is written to randomly select a user agent from the list.
     - Each request made to a website uses a randomly chosen user agent for better flexibility.

---

### 3. **Reusable Functions**
   - **Make Request Function**:
     - A reusable function is created to:
       - Send a GET request to each page in the sitemap.
       - Parse and return the response.

---

### 4. **Main Workflow**
   - **Input**:
     - The main function takes an XML sitemap as input.
   - **Processing**:
     - It reads and extracts links from the sitemap.
     - Sends these links to a **crawling function**.
   - **Crawling**:
     - The crawler visits each link and uses the reusable functions to fetch the metadata.
   - **Output**:
     - The extracted SEO data is stored for analysis.

---

### 5. **Implementation Highlights**
   - **Error Handling**:
     - Managing HTTP request failures.
   - **Concurrency** (if using Golang):
     - The crawler might use goroutines for faster crawling.
   - **Extensibility**:
     - Additional metadata or processing can be added easily.

---

This project is ideal for:
- **SEO analysis**.
- Automating sitemap crawling to extract valuable metadata for website audits.
